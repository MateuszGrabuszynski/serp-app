## How to run
First run:

docker exec -it serp_backend_1 python manage.py makemigrations
docker exec -it serp_backend_1 python manage.py migrate
docker exec -it serp_backend_1 python manage.py createsuperuser
```

Later:
```
docker-compose up

## Explain
* Normally, I should not add `.env` file with `SECRET_KEY` here because of security, but it's more convenient to do it like that right now.
* `no` is often used as an abbreviation of `number_of`, so i.e. `no_results` is `number_of_results`.
* Sometimes there is one or more results missing (i.e. when you type 30, you get 29 results) - that's because some of the additional Google boxes in search are counted as a result (tweaks would be needed to repair that behaviour).
